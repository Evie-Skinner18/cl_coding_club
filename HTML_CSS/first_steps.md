# First Steps in HTML and CSS

## Portfolio Website Challenge

_Techie Requirements:_
- Use HTML and vanilla CSS
- Use semantic markup
- Research accessiblity issues with web development. How will these factors influence the way you build your website?
- One page is enough for now: keep it simple!
- Use an interesting font
- Use an eye-catching mixture of colours

_Content Requirements:_
- A professional photo of yourself
- A navbar
- A section about you
- A section about what motivates you to code (the 'why')!



Don't worry if you don't manage to fulfill all of these points. Quality over quantity is the goal.
